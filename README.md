# Daily-Work-Planner

This application is a work scheduler that can be used to as a planner to lay out the day by the hour. This application shows color-coded textboxes for the user to submit a message into, these textboxes are coded according to the time. If the textbox is in the past it will appear gray, if the textbox is in the current hour it will be red, and if the textbox is in the future it will appear green. Example: it is currently 12 pm-- the textboxes for 9, 10 and 11 am appear gray, the 12 pm timebox is red, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pm are all green. When the user submits their message with the submit button, it is then logged into local stoage to be accessed when necessary.
